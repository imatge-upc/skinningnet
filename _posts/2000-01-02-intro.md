This work presents SkinningNet, a Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Neural Network that automatically generates skinning weights for an input mesh and its associated skeleton. The SkinningNet architecture is based on the novel Multi-Aggregator Graph Convolution layer that allows the network to better generalize for unseen topologies. Moreover, the proposed joint-based skin binding and Mesh-Skeleton network learns to find the best relationships between the mesh and skeleton, helping to improve the final skinning weight predictions. The proposed architecture outperforms current approaches with over a 20% improvement on mesh deformation error and is also able to generalize better for complex characters of unseen domains.
